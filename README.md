# About me
Hi there, my name is Jess :smile: I'm a life-long learner who dabbles in *everything*! 

### My Journey
After going to school for math and teaching, I started my journey as a secondary school educator to empower students in my classrooms to think critically, not just in the context of academics but also in their everyday lives. My focus was on integrating technology to enhance student learning (you'd be surprised how many high school and college students don't know how to properly use tools like Google, text editors, spreadsheets, or even calculators to help them solve problems). 

I eventually joined an ed-tech start-up called Wize, where I helped design and lead programs to support secondary and post-secondary school students in learning key STEM and business concepts in order to continue their education in their desired fields. Not only did I get the opportunity to hone my skills in training and development, leadership, and program planning, I also gained valuable skills in business analytics and development, product design, and product management. In my 3 years at this company, I discovered my love and passion for data and how it can be used to guide all sorts of decisions.

Fast-forward to the end of 2021, my partner and I decided to move from London, Ontario to San Diego (we literally made the decision to move, got all our affairs sorted, and did the 40 hour drive all within 3 weeks). In some weird cosmic way, this move gave me the courage to pursue my passions in data (for those who know me, they'll tell you how risk avert I can be when it comes to career moves). I am now proudly job-less but happily exploring the world of data, machine learning, and programming everyday.
