# About me
Hi there, my name is Jess :smile: I'm a life-long learner who dabbles in *everything*! 

### My Journey
I started my career as a math educator working with a wide cross-section of learners. This made my realize that I love helping people and that I'm customer-obsessed! I developed a knack for listening to and observing people to understand what they want and what they need. 

I eventually joined an ed-tech start-up that leveraged technology and digital solutions to support student learning. As the director of education I had the opportunity to wear many different hats -- from working with the executives to define business goals, product vision, and growth & marketing strategies, to working in the thick of things, where I consolidated and analyzed tons of user data, conducted many user interviews to gather requirements and user stories, performed market research and competitive landscape analyses. I discovered my passion for using data and analytics to arrive at decisions that are based on facts, rather than gut intuition. Thanks to my teaching background, I was able to clearly present these solutions and strategies while using data visualizations to tell the story, which helped me get buy-in from internal and external stakeholders everytime.

Fast-forward to 2022, my partner and I decided to move from London, Ontario to San Diego (we literally made the decision to move, got all our affairs sorted, and did the 40 hour drive all within 3 weeks). This gave me the courage to pursue my passion for data and how it can be used for better decision making. I am now happily exploring the world of data, machine learning, and programming everyday.
